Generic single-database configuration for HomeRack Backend.

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for the HomeRack database.

## Configuration

The alembic configuration is set up to work with the existing SQLAlchemy setup:
- Database URL is imported from app/database.py
- All models are imported in env.py to enable autogenerate
- Works with SQLite by default (can be configured for other databases)

## Usage

Generate a new migration (autogenerate):
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

Apply migrations:
    alembic upgrade head

Downgrade one version:
    alembic downgrade -1

Show current revision:
    alembic current

Show migration history:
    alembic history

## Important Notes

- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying them
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- Keep migrations in version control
- Never edit applied migrations - create new ones instead
