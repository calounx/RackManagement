# HomeRack Light Load Test Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-12 07:41:20
**Base URL:** http://lampadas.local:8080

## System Configuration

- **Deployment:** Single-worker FastAPI (not production-grade)
- **Database:** SQLite (single-user)
- **Server:** lampadas.local:8080

## Load Test Philosophy

This is a **LIGHT LOAD TEST**, not a stress test. The purpose is to:
- Detect obvious concurrency issues
- Verify the system handles minimal concurrent load
- Identify race conditions or database locking issues

This is NOT designed to:
- Test maximum throughput
- Stress test the system
- Determine production capacity

## Test Results

| Test | Concurrent Requests | Success | Failed | Avg Response Time (ms) | Total Time (s) | Status |
|------|---------------------|---------|--------|------------------------|----------------|--------|
