# HomeRack Light Load Test Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-12 07:41:34
**Base URL:** http://lampadas.local:8080

## System Configuration

- **Deployment:** Single-worker FastAPI (not production-grade)
- **Database:** SQLite (single-user)
- **Server:** lampadas.local:8080

## Load Test Philosophy

This is a **LIGHT LOAD TEST**, not a stress test. The purpose is to:
- Detect obvious concurrency issues
- Verify the system handles minimal concurrent load
- Identify race conditions or database locking issues

This is NOT designed to:
- Test maximum throughput
- Stress test the system
- Determine production capacity

## Common Issues in Single-Worker Systems

When testing single-worker systems with SQLite, common issues include:

1. **Database Locking**: SQLite locks the entire database for writes
2. **No Parallelism**: Single worker processes requests sequentially
3. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Limited database connections
4. **Memory Pressure**: All requests share same process memory

## Recommendations

### For Current System (Development)

1. **Monitor database locks**: Check for SQLite locking issues
2. **Add request queuing**: Implement graceful request queuing
3. **Cache read-heavy endpoints**: Reduce database load
4. **Optimize slow queries**: Profile and optimize database queries

### For Production Deployment

1. **Use Multiple Workers**: Deploy with gunicorn/uvicorn workers
2. **Migrate to PostgreSQL**: Better concurrency support
3. **Implement Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across workers
4. **Add Redis Caching**: Reduce database pressure
5. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protect against overload

## Concurrency Limits Observed

Based on these light load tests:

- ⚠️ System shows failures under light concurrent load
- Recommend investigating database locking and query optimization
- Consider implementing request queuing or rate limiting


## Next Steps

1. **If tests passed**: System is suitable for development/single-user
2. **If tests failed**: Investigate failures and optimize bottlenecks
3. **Before production**: Migrate to production-grade deployment
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerting
